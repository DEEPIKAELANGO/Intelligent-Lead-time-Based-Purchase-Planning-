# Intelligent-Lead-time-Based-Purchase-Planning-

_**Reasons for selecting this theme​:**_

**Reason 1:** 

Solving Real Manufacturing Pain Points Manufacturing industries lose millions annually due to production stoppages
caused by material shortages. This theme allows me to demonstrate how technology can solve critical supply chain challenges
affecting thousands of companies globally. ​

**Reason 2:** 

Showcasing End-to-End Development Skills The Developer Track perfectly aligns with my project requiring full-stack
capabilities—Python/Pandas for data processing, Power BI for visualization, and DAX for real-time calculations. This demonstrates
proficiency across multiple technologies in a single cohesive solution. ​

**Reason 3:** 

Building Production-Ready, Scalable Solutions Rather than a theoretical concept, I chose this track to build a
deployment-ready system that can be immediately implemented in real businesses, prioritizing functionality, performance, and user
experience—essential skills for modern software development.

_**HOW THIS SOLUTION SOLVES USER PROBLEMS​**_

1. **Eliminates Manual Excel Work:** Procurement managers save 18 hours per week by automating data tracking,
calculation, and report generation—transforming a 3-hour Monday morning task into a 3-second dashboard refresh.​

2. **Provides Clear Priorities:** Color-coded alerts (Red/Yellow/Green) instantly show which materials need immediate action
versus which are on track, eliminating the guesswork and anxiety of "what should I order first?“​

3. **Shifts from Reactive to Proactive:** Users receive 4-6 week advance warnings about upcoming shortages, allowing them
to place orders calmly and strategically instead of constantly firefighting and paying for expedited shipping.​

4. **Prevents Production Downtime:** Production planners gain 12-week visibility into material availability, enabling confident
production scheduling and eliminating last-minute schedule changes that frustrate both staff and customers.​

5. **Reduces Financial Waste:** Finance teams see ₹12M in annual savings through 70% reduction in expedited shipping
costs, optimized inventory levels (freeing up working capital), and zero lost production revenue from stockouts.​

6. **Enables Data-Driven Decisions:** Plant managers and executives gain real-time visibility into procurement efficiency,
supplier performance, and cost trends—replacing gut feelings with concrete metrics for strategic planning.​

  ​7. **Improves Work-Life Balance:** Users report sleeping better at night knowing the automated system is monitoring
everything, catching issues before they become crises, and transforming their role from "blamed for failures" to
"celebrated for prevention.“​

8. **Drives Career Growth:** Procurement professionals can now prove their impact with measurable KPIs (stockouts
prevented, savings generated, on-time performance), leading to promotions and recognition instead of being invisible
until something goes wrong.
