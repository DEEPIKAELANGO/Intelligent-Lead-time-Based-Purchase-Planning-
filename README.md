# Intelligent-Lead-time-Based-Purchase-Planning-

**Reasons for selecting this theme​:**

**Reason 1:** 

Solving Real Manufacturing Pain Points Manufacturing industries lose millions annually due to production stoppages
caused by material shortages. This theme allows me to demonstrate how technology can solve critical supply chain challenges
affecting thousands of companies globally. ​

**Reason 2:** 

Showcasing End-to-End Development Skills The Developer Track perfectly aligns with my project requiring full-stack
capabilities—Python/Pandas for data processing, Power BI for visualization, and DAX for real-time calculations. This demonstrates
proficiency across multiple technologies in a single cohesive solution. ​

**Reason 3:** 

Building Production-Ready, Scalable Solutions Rather than a theoretical concept, I chose this track to build a
deployment-ready system that can be immediately implemented in real businesses, prioritizing functionality, performance, and user
experience—essential skills for modern software development.
